<center><h1>Changing cut-off</font></h1></center>

<p><font color="blue">LeView</font> allows the user to change the cut-off distance for hydrogen bonds and close residues. The initial cut-off distance for hydrogen bonds is 3.3&Aring; for hydrogen bonds and 4.0&Aring; for close residues. These can be changed by sliding the corresponding cut-off bar at the bottom of the frame. 
</p>

<p>
While you are in the "move elements" mode, the maximum cut-off distance remains fixed at the one chosen before you switched on this mode. You will need to deactivate this mode in order to increase the cut-off distance.
